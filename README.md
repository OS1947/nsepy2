# nsepy2

<h2>The objective</h2>
To build an OpenLibrary which can be utilised to consume stock related data available in public domain. Currently, stocks which are traded at NSE-India are only being considered.

<h2>Inspiration and Current State</h2>
As the original repo 'NSEpy' is not being actively developed, I am trying to extend the project as much as I can. Please be so kind to contribute as much as you can. Small contributions can also help.

This project is inspired from 'NSEpy' -> https://github.com/swapniljariwala/nsepy.

<h2>Phases</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Documentation for NSEpy</li>
  <li>New development</li>
  <li>Ammend Documentation</li>
 </ol>
 

<h3>Current phase: Documentation for NSEpy</h3>
At this moment I am just preparing some documentation so that it'll be easier for others to use 'NSEpy'.
